# DevOps Lifecycle

## What is DevOps?

DevOps is a cultural and operational philosophy that bridges the gap between software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). It emphasizes collaboration, automation, and continuous improvement to accelerate software delivery while maintaining high quality and reliability.

## Core DevOps Principles

- **Collaboration**: Breaking down silos between development and operations teams
- **Automation**: Reducing manual processes through tools and scripts
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Frequent code integration and automated deployment
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Managing infrastructure through version-controlled code
- **Monitoring and Feedback**: Continuous observation and improvement based on metrics

## DevOps Lifecycle Stages

### 1. Planning
Strategic phase where teams define requirements, set goals, and create project roadmaps. This stage involves collaboration between stakeholders to establish clear objectives and timelines.

### 2. Development
Developers write code following best practices, version control, and collaborative development methodologies. Code is regularly committed to shared repositories with proper documentation.

### 3. Building
Source code is compiled, packaged, and prepared for deployment through automated build processes. This stage includes dependency management and artifact creation.

### 4. Testing
Comprehensive testing including unit tests, integration tests, and security scans to ensure code quality. Automated testing frameworks validate functionality and catch bugs early.

### 5. Release
Approved code is prepared for production deployment with proper versioning and release notes. Release management ensures controlled and coordinated software delivery.

### 6. Deployment
Automated deployment of applications to target environments using deployment pipelines. Infrastructure provisioning and configuration management occur during this phase.

### 7. Operations
Day-to-day management of production systems including maintenance, updates, and issue resolution. Operations teams ensure system availability and performance.

### 8. Monitoring
Continuous observation of application performance, infrastructure health, and user experience. Monitoring provides insights for optimization and proactive issue detection.
